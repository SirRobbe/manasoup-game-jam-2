This was the submission from Kreative Kraut to the Manasoup Game Jam 2.
In DreamKeeper you play a little creature that is the companion of our young hero.
The hero is hunted by nightmares you have to protect her from.
At the beginning of each session you can select between different tarrot cards that influence her dreams, which gives you different abilities you can use to fight of the nightmares.
